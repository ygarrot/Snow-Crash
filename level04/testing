what I tried: 
level04@SnowCrash:~$ cat /var/tmp/suid.c
PATH=/var/tmp:$PATH ./level04.pl x='` getflag`'

https://lea-linux.org/documentations/Dev-suid_scripts
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/364/allow-setuid-on-shell-scripts

script with bang #! have a special interaction with suid
But perl has a suid_safe mode that disallow user running suid script
so this method doesn't work
( ruby has a taint mode with perl -T ) // doesn't matter here
